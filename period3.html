                <h2>Key Themes</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Colonial resistance leading to independence.</li>
                    <li>Formation of a new government and political ideologies.</li>
                    <li>Debates over federal versus state power.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Road to Revolution</h2>
                
                <h3>Albany Plan of Union (1754)</h3>
                <p>During the French and Indian War, Benjamin Franklin proposed the first formal plan to unite the colonies. The plan called for a colonial-wide government with powers to tax, manage military defenses, and handle foreign relations. While rejected by both the colonies (unwilling to surrender autonomy) and the British crown (wary of colonial unity), it foreshadowed later attempts at colonial cooperation.</p>
                
                <h3>Proclamation of 1763</h3>
                <p>Following the French and Indian War, the British crown prohibited colonial settlement west of the Appalachian Mountains. This attempt to limit conflict with Native Americans angered colonists who wanted western lands. It was the first of several British policies that colonists viewed as restricting their economic opportunities and freedoms.</p>
                
                <h3>Stamp Act (1765)</h3>
                <p>The first direct tax on colonists, requiring stamps on printed materials including legal documents, newspapers, and playing cards. Colonial resistance was organized, widespread, and sometimes violent, with groups like the Sons of Liberty forming to coordinate boycotts and protests. The controversy established the principle of "no taxation without representation" as colonists argued Parliament could not tax them when they had no elected representatives.</p>
                
                <h3>Boston Massacre (1770)</h3>
                <p>Confrontation in which British soldiers killed five colonists. Patriots used the incident as effective propaganda, with Paul Revere's engraving depicting a deliberate firing line rather than the chaotic situation that actually occurred. The event increased anti-British sentiment, although John Adams successfully defended the soldiers in court, demonstrating colonial commitment to rule of law.</p>
                
                <h3>Boston Tea Party (1773)</h3>
                <p>Colonial protest against the Tea Act in which activists dumped 342 chests of British tea into Boston Harbor. While the Tea Act actually lowered the price of tea, colonists objected to the principle of taxation and the monopoly granted to the East India Company. The British response—the Intolerable Acts—pushed many moderates toward supporting independence.</p>
                
                <h3>Intolerable Acts (1774)</h3>
                <p>Series of punitive measures against Massachusetts, including closing Boston's port, altering the Massachusetts charter, allowing troops to be quartered in private homes, and removing trials of royal officials to England. Rather than isolating Massachusetts, these acts united the colonies in resistance and led directly to the First Continental Congress.</p>

                <h2>American Revolution</h2>
                
                <h3>Common Sense (1776)</h3>
                <p>Thomas Paine's influential pamphlet advocating American independence with clear, persuasive arguments in plain language. Paine rejected reconciliation with Britain, argued that monarchy was inherently corrupt, and made a case that America could thrive as an independent nation. The pamphlet sold over 100,000 copies and was instrumental in shifting public opinion toward independence.</p>
                
                <h3>Lexington and Concord (April 19, 1775)</h3>
                <p>The first military engagements of the Revolutionary War, known as "the shot heard 'round the world." British troops marching to seize colonial weapons were confronted by colonial minutemen. The British suffered heavy casualties as they retreated to Boston, and news of the battle galvanized colonial resistance. The Second Continental Congress subsequently established the Continental Army with George Washington as commander.</p>
                
                <h3>Saratoga (1777)</h3>
                <p>Major American victory that convinced France to ally with the colonies. General Horatio Gates defeated British General John Burgoyne, forcing the surrender of nearly 6,000 British troops. The victory demonstrated that the Americans could defeat the British in a conventional battle and persuaded France (and later Spain and the Netherlands) to provide crucial military and financial support to the American cause.</p>
                
                <h3>Valley Forge (1777-78)</h3>
                <p>Continental Army's difficult winter encampment in Pennsylvania where troops faced severe shortages of food, clothing, and shelter. Despite harsh conditions that led to significant suffering and some desertions, the army emerged more disciplined and better trained thanks to the efforts of officers like Baron von Steuben. The experience became a symbol of American perseverance.</p>
                
                <h3>Yorktown (1781)</h3>
                <p>Final major battle of the war in which American and French forces trapped British General Cornwallis on the York Peninsula in Virginia. French naval forces prevented British evacuation by sea while Washington's and Rochambeau's troops besieged the British position. Cornwallis surrendered his 8,000 troops on October 19, effectively ending major combat operations and leading to peace negotiations.</p>
                
                <h3>Treaty of Paris (1783)</h3>
                <p>Agreement that formally ended the Revolutionary War. Key provisions included British recognition of American independence, establishment of the Mississippi River as the western boundary, American fishing rights off Canada, promises to repay British creditors and recommend restoration of loyalist property, and British withdrawal from all American territory. The treaty represented a remarkable diplomatic victory for the young nation.</p>

                <h2>Early Republic</h2>
                
                <h3>Articles of Confederation</h3>
                <p>America's first constitution, ratified in 1781, created a loose association of states with a weak central government. The federal government lacked the power to tax, regulate trade, or enforce laws, requiring unanimous consent for amendments. While flawed, the Articles did achieve some successes, including the Land Ordinance of 1785 and Northwest Ordinance of 1787, which established processes for organizing western territories.</p>
                
                <h3>Shays' Rebellion (1786-87)</h3>
                <p>Western Massachusetts uprising led by farmer and Revolutionary War veteran Daniel Shays. The rebels, many facing debt and foreclosure, closed courts to prevent property seizures. Though eventually suppressed by state militia, the rebellion alarmed elites by highlighting the central government's weakness and the potential for social disorder. It provided momentum for constitutional reform and was cited by federalists as evidence that a stronger government was needed.</p>
                
                <h3>Constitutional Convention (1787)</h3>
                <p>Meeting in Philadelphia of delegates from 12 states (Rhode Island declined to participate) to revise the Articles of Confederation. Led by figures like Washington, Madison, and Franklin, the delegates instead drafted an entirely new constitution. Key compromises included:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Great Compromise</strong>: Established a bicameral legislature with proportional representation in the House and equal state representation in the Senate</li>
                    <li><strong>Three-Fifths Compromise</strong>: Counted three-fifths of enslaved persons for representation and direct taxation</li>
                    <li><strong>Commerce Compromise</strong>: Gave Congress power to regulate interstate and foreign trade but prohibited taxes on exports and limits on slave trade for 20 years</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Federalist Papers</h3>
                <p>Series of 85 essays by Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and John Jay supporting ratification of the Constitution. Published in New York newspapers under the pseudonym "Publius," they addressed concerns about the new government and explained its structure and benefits. Particularly influential were Madison's arguments about controlling factions through a large republic (No. 10) and the separation of powers (No. 51).</p>
                
                <h3>Washington's Presidency (1789-97)</h3>
                <p>George Washington established crucial precedents as the first president, including a two-term limit, cabinet system, and execution of federal law. His administration faced early tests like the Whiskey Rebellion, navigated foreign policy challenges during the French Revolution, and tried to maintain neutrality amid European conflicts. Washington's Farewell Address warned against permanent alliances and partisan divisions.</p>
                
                <h3>Partisan Divisions</h3>
                <p>Despite Washington's warnings, the 1790s saw the emergence of the first party system with Alexander Hamilton's Federalists supporting a strong central government, industrialization, and pro-British policies, while Thomas Jefferson and James Madison's Democratic-Republicans favored states' rights, agrarianism, and sympathy toward France. These divisions reflected fundamental disagreements about the nation's economic future and constitutional interpretation.</p>
                
                <h3>XYZ Affair (1797-98)</h3>
                <p>Diplomatic crisis with France during Adams' presidency when French officials (dubbed X, Y, and Z) demanded bribes before negotiations. The revelation outraged Americans and led to an undeclared "Quasi-War" with France, mainly fought at sea. The subsequent war fever allowed Federalists to pass the controversial Alien and Sedition Acts, which restricted immigration and limited criticism of the government, but eventually backfired politically.</p>

                <h2>Legacy of the Revolution</h2>
                
                <h3>Political Innovations</h3>
                <p>The American Revolution established precedents for republican government, written constitutions, checks and balances, and federalism that influenced later democratic movements worldwide. The Constitution's emphasis on limited government power and protection of individual rights was revolutionary in an age of monarchies.</p>
                
                <h3>Expansion of Rights</h3>
                <p>While still limited by modern standards, the Revolution expanded notions of equality and political participation. Many states broadened voting rights for white men by reducing or eliminating property requirements, several states abolished slavery, and opportunities for women's education increased. Nevertheless, enslaved people, Native Americans, and women remained largely excluded from the Revolution's promises.</p>
                
                <h3>Native American Relations</h3>
                <p>The Revolution generally worsened conditions for Native Americans, as British surrender removed a check on westward expansion. Tribes that had allied with Britain faced retribution, while the new American government's weak federal authority limited its ability to honor treaties, leading to continued conflicts and westward displacement of native peoples.</p>
                
                <h3>Cultural Impacts</h3>
                <p>The Revolution fostered a distinctive American identity separate from British culture. This was expressed through literature, art, and symbols like the American flag and eagle. Religious liberty and separation of church and state became foundational principles, while the ideal of republicanism—prizing civic virtue and sacrifice for the common good—influenced American social values.</p>
