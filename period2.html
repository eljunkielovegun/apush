                <h2>Key Themes</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Development of British colonies with regional differences.</li>
                    <li>Interactions and conflicts with Native Americans.</li>
                    <li>Introduction and entrenchment of African slavery.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Regional Colonial Development</h2>
                
                <h3>New England Colonies</h3>
                <p><strong>Plymouth (1620)</strong>: Religious separatists (Pilgrims) seeking freedom from the Church of England established this colony after arriving on the Mayflower. The Mayflower Compact served as an early form of self-government.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Massachusetts Bay Colony (1630)</strong>: Larger Puritan settlement governed by John Winthrop, who envisioned it as a "city upon a hill" - a model Christian community. Religious conformity was strictly enforced, leading to conflicts like the banishment of Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Economy</strong>: Based on shipbuilding, fishing, timber harvesting, and small farming. Rocky soil and short growing seasons limited agricultural production, pushing settlers toward maritime activities and trade.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Society</strong>: Town-centered, church-focused communities with high literacy rates. Puritans valued education, leading to the founding of Harvard College (1636) and a system of public education. Family and community were central organizing principles.</p>
                
                <h3>Middle Colonies</h3>
                <p><strong>New York</strong>: Originally established as New Netherland by the Dutch, this colony was captured by the English in 1664 and renamed. The Dutch left lasting cultural influences, including tolerance for diverse religions.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Pennsylvania (1681)</strong>: Founded by William Penn as a haven for Quakers and other persecuted religious groups. Penn established good relations with Native Americans and implemented relatively democratic governance.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Economy</strong>: Often called the "breadbasket colonies" due to fertile soil that produced wheat and other grains. Also developed diverse manufacturing and merchant activities in urban centers like Philadelphia and New York.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Society</strong>: Most ethnically and religiously diverse region, including English, Dutch, Germans (Pennsylvania Dutch), Scots-Irish, Swedes, and various Protestant denominations, Catholics, and Jews.</p>
                
                <h3>Southern Colonies</h3>
                <p><strong>Virginia</strong>: First permanent English settlement at Jamestown (1607) struggled initially but thrived with tobacco cultivation. Economy dominated by wealthy planters who controlled both economic and political life.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Maryland (1634)</strong>: Founded as a haven for Catholics by Lord Baltimore. The Act of Toleration (1649) provided religious freedom to Christians, though it was later repealed.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Carolinas/Georgia</strong>: Developed economies based on rice, indigo, and timber. Georgia was initially established as a buffer against Spanish Florida and as a haven for debtors, though these original plans quickly changed.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Society</strong>: Plantation system with growing reliance on slavery. Social hierarchy placed wealthy planters at the top, followed by small farmers, indentured servants, and enslaved Africans at the bottom. Lower population density and fewer towns than in northern colonies.</p>

                <h2>Slavery and Race</h2>
                
                <h3>First Africans in Virginia (1619)</h3>
                <p>The first Africans arrived in Virginia aboard a Dutch trading ship. Initially, they likely had a status similar to indentured servants, with the possibility of eventual freedom. Some early African arrivals did gain freedom and even acquired property and servants of their own.</p>
                
                <h3>Shift to Chattel Slavery</h3>
                <p>By the late 17th century, colonial laws increasingly defined slavery as a hereditary, lifelong condition based on race. Virginia's slave codes of 1705 consolidated various laws, defining slaves as property rather than persons under the law.</p>
                
                <p>Key factors in this transition included:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Need for a stable workforce for labor-intensive crops like tobacco, rice, and indigo</li>
                    <li>Economic advantage of owning workers for life rather than for limited terms</li>
                    <li>Declining availability of European indentured servants</li>
                    <li>Development of racial ideologies to justify enslavement</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3>Middle Passage</h3>
                <p>Brutal transport of enslaved Africans across the Atlantic, during which many died from disease, malnutrition, and mistreatment. Ships were overcrowded, with people chained together in unsanitary conditions. The trauma of this forced migration was the beginning of the slave experience in America.</p>
                
                <h3>Stono Rebellion (1739)</h3>
                <p>Largest slave uprising in colonial period, occurring near the Stono River in South Carolina. Led by a man called Jemmy, about 100 enslaved people killed slave owners and attempted to escape to Spanish Florida. The rebellion was suppressed, and the participants were executed. The aftermath led to stricter slave codes and increased restrictions on African Americans.</p>

                <h2>Colonial Political Development</h2>
                
                <h3>House of Burgesses (Virginia, 1619)</h3>
                <p>First representative assembly in the colonies, established to address local concerns and make laws. While limited in who could participate (property-owning white men), it established a precedent for representative government in America.</p>
                
                <h3>Navigation Acts (1651, 1660s)</h3>
                <p>Series of laws passed by Parliament to control colonial trade within the mercantilist system. These acts required colonial goods to be shipped on English vessels and many products to be shipped to England first before going to other markets. The acts benefitted English merchants and ship owners while restricting colonial economic independence.</p>
                
                <h3>Glorious Revolution (1688-89)</h3>
                <p>The overthrow of King James II in England had significant effects in the colonies, where several uprisings against royal governors occurred. The aftermath enhanced the power of colonial assemblies relative to royal appointees and reinforced the idea that even monarchs were subject to law.</p>
                
                <h3>Salutary Neglect</h3>
                <p>Period of limited British enforcement of trade regulations from approximately 1720 to 1750. Under Robert Walpole's government, Britain adopted a hands-off approach to colonial governance, allowing colonies to develop their own political institutions and practices. This period fostered colonial self-government and economic development while maintaining loyalty to Britain.</p>

                <h2>Relations with Native Americans</h2>
                
                <h3>Early Alliances and Trade</h3>
                <p>Initial colonial-Native American relationships often involved mutually beneficial trade and military alliances. Native peoples provided essential knowledge about local environments and agricultural techniques. The Powhatan Confederacy initially aided Jamestown's survival, while the Wampanoag helped the Plymouth colonists.</p>
                
                <h3>Rising Tensions</h3>
                <p>As colonial populations grew and expanded territorially, conflicts over land became increasingly common. English concepts of land ownership clashed with Native American understandings of land use rights.</p>
                
                <h3>Significant Conflicts</h3>
                <p><strong>Powhatan Wars (1610-1646)</strong>: Series of conflicts between Virginia colonists and the Powhatan Confederacy, ending with the defeat of the Powhatan and large cessions of land.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Pequot War (1636-1638)</strong>: Conflict in New England that resulted in the near extermination of the Pequot tribe and established English dominance in the region.</p>
                
                <p><strong>King Philip's War (1675-1678)</strong>: Devastating conflict in New England led by Metacom (King Philip) of the Wampanoag. The war resulted in high casualties on both sides but ultimately broke Native American power in the region.</p>
                
                <h3>Cultural Interactions</h3>
                <p>Despite conflicts, cultural exchange occurred in areas like agriculture, medicine, and language. Some colonists lived among Native peoples as traders or missionaries, while some Native Americans adapted aspects of European culture or converted to Christianity.</p>
                
                <h3>Shifting Alliances</h3>
                <p>Native American groups often played European powers against each other for strategic advantage. This was particularly evident in competitions between English, French, and Spanish colonies, where Native alliances could determine the balance of power in a region.</p>

                <h2>Colonial Culture and Society</h2>
                
                <h3>Religion</h3>
                <p>Religion was central to colonial life, though its role varied by region. New England was dominated by Congregationalist Puritans, the Middle Colonies featured religious diversity, and the Southern Colonies were nominally Anglican with less daily religious focus.</p>
                
                <p>The Great Awakening (1730s-1740s) was a religious revival that swept across the colonies, challenging established churches. Led by preachers like Jonathan Edwards and George Whitefield, it emphasized individual spiritual experience over formal theology. The movement promoted ideas of religious choice and individual conscience that would later influence revolutionary thinking.</p>
                
                <h3>Education</h3>
                <p>Education levels varied significantly by region and social class. New England established public schools early, while southern education was primarily private and focused on the elite. The first colleges, including Harvard (1636), William & Mary (1693), and Yale (1701), were established primarily to train ministers.</p>
                
                <h3>Family Life</h3>
                <p>Families were both economic and social units, with household production as the norm. High birth rates (7-10 children per family) compensated for high infant mortality. Gender roles were strictly defined, with women responsible for household management, childrearing, and home production, while men worked in fields, workshops, or professions.</p>
                
                <h3>Class Structure</h3>
                <p>Colonial society was hierarchical but offered more mobility than European society of the time. The absence of a hereditary aristocracy and availability of land created opportunities, though access to these opportunities was limited by race, gender, and often religion.</p>
