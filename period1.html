                <h2>Key Themes</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Diverse Native American societies adapted to their environments.</li>
                    <li>European exploration driven by the 3 G's: Gold, Glory, and God.</li>
                    <li>Columbian Exchange transformed global economies and ecologies.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Native American Societies (Pre-Contact)</h2>
                
                <h3>Northeast Woodlands</h3>
                <p>Iroquois Confederacy (Haudenosaunee) developed a sophisticated political system with the Great Law of Peace. They practiced agriculture with the "Three Sisters" (corn, beans, squash), which allowed for efficient farming and nutrition.</p>
                
                <h3>Southeast</h3>
                <p>Mississippi culture created large mound-building settlements. Cherokee, Creek, and Seminole established complex agricultural societies with hierarchical social structures and extensive trade networks.</p>
                
                <h3>Great Plains</h3>
                <p>Nomadic tribes like Sioux, Comanche, and Blackfoot followed buffalo herds for survival. They developed horse culture after European contact, which dramatically changed their hunting and warfare capabilities.</p>
                
                <h3>Southwest</h3>
                <p>Pueblo peoples built multi-story adobe dwellings in areas with limited water. Hopi and Zuni created extensive irrigation systems that allowed for farming in arid environments.</p>
                
                <h3>Northwest Coast</h3>
                <p>Tlingit, Haida, and Chinook developed resource-rich societies with potlatch ceremonies and totem poles. These cultures had abundant food supplies from fishing and developed complex art forms.</p>

                <h2>Early European Exploration</h2>
                
                <h3>Christopher Columbus (1492)</h3>
                <p>First voyage led to permanent European awareness of the Americas. Though he was searching for a route to Asia, his "discovery" initiated an era of exploration and colonization.</p>
                
                <h3>Spanish Conquistadors</h3>
                <p>Hernán Cortés conquered Aztec Empire (1519-1521) with a small force aided by local allies and disease. Francisco Pizarro defeated Inca Empire (1532) using similar tactics and exploiting internal divisions.</p>
                
                <h3>Treaty of Tordesillas (1494)</h3>
                <p>Divided newly discovered lands between Spain and Portugal. This papal-sanctioned agreement gave Spain rights to most of the Americas while Portugal received Brazil and claims in Africa and Asia.</p>
                
                <h3>Bartolomé de las Casas</h3>
                <p>Spanish priest who advocated for humane treatment of indigenous peoples. His writings documented Spanish abuses and influenced later colonial policies toward Native Americans.</p>

                <h2>The Columbian Exchange</h2>
                
                <h3>Crops to Old World</h3>
                <p>Corn, potatoes, tomatoes, chocolate, tobacco, squash, beans, and peppers were introduced to Europe and Africa. These crops transformed diets and agricultural practices worldwide.</p>
                
                <h3>Crops to New World</h3>
                <p>Wheat, sugar, coffee, rice, bananas, and citrus fruits were brought to the Americas. Livestock including horses, cattle, pigs, sheep, and chickens also transformed the American landscape.</p>
                
                <h3>Disease Impact</h3>
                <p>Smallpox, measles, influenza, and other diseases devastated Native populations who lacked immunity. Up to 90% population decline occurred in some regions, fundamentally altering the balance of power.</p>
                
                <h3>Economic Transformation</h3>
                <p>New crops and resources changed global trade patterns and diets. The influx of precious metals from the Americas contributed to inflation in Europe but also financed further exploration and colonization.</p>

                <h2>Spanish Colonization</h2>
                
                <h3>Encomienda System</h3>
                <p>Spanish colonizers were granted control over indigenous populations for labor. This system led to widespread abuse and contributed to population decline among Native peoples.</p>
                
                <h3>Mission System</h3>
                <p>Religious institutions established to convert indigenous peoples to Christianity. While providing some protection, missions also disrupted traditional ways of life and exposed Native Americans to European diseases.</p>
                
                <h3>Silver Mining</h3>
                <p>Mines at Potosí (Bolivia) and Zacatecas (Mexico) became crucial to the Spanish Empire. The silver extracted funded Spanish power in Europe but cost countless indigenous lives through forced labor.</p>
                
                <h3>Social Hierarchies</h3>
                <p>Complex racial classification system developed in Spanish colonies. Peninsulares (Spanish-born) were at the top, followed by criollos (Spanish descent born in Americas), mestizos (mixed), and indigenous and enslaved African peoples at the bottom.</p>
