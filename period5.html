                <h2>Key Themes</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Manifest Destiny and territorial expansion.</li>
                    <li>Intensifying sectional conflicts over slavery.</li>
                    <li>Civil War and efforts to rebuild the nation.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Manifest Destiny and Territorial Expansion</h2>
                
                <h3>Mexican-American War (1846–1848)</h3>
                <p>Conflict that began over boundary disputes following the U.S. annexation of Texas. President Polk, an expansionist, sent troops to the disputed area, where a skirmish provided the pretext for war. American forces under Generals Zachary Taylor and Winfield Scott won a series of victories, culminating in the capture of Mexico City. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo added vast territories to the United States, including California and the Southwest. The war intensified debates over the expansion of slavery into new territories and raised questions about American imperialism.</p>
                
                <h3>Compromise of 1850</h3>
                <p>Complex legislative package designed by Henry Clay and shepherded through Congress by Stephen Douglas to resolve sectional tensions following the Mexican-American War. Key provisions included:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Admission of California as a free state</li>
                    <li>Organization of New Mexico and Utah territories under popular sovereignty</li>
                    <li>Resolution of the Texas-New Mexico boundary dispute</li>
                    <li>Abolition of the slave trade (but not slavery) in Washington D.C.</li>
                    <li>A stronger Fugitive Slave Act requiring Northern cooperation in returning escaped slaves</li>
                </ul>
                <p>While temporarily easing tensions, the Compromise's enforcement, particularly the Fugitive Slave Act, exacerbated sectional divisions and galvanized anti-slavery sentiment in the North.</p>
                
                <h3>Kansas-Nebraska Act (1854)</h3>
                <p>Legislation that organized the Kansas and Nebraska territories with the principle of popular sovereignty determining their slave or free status. The act effectively repealed the Missouri Compromise by allowing the possibility of slavery north of the 36°30' parallel. Senator Stephen Douglas promoted the bill to facilitate western development and a transcontinental railroad, but it had profound political consequences, including the collapse of the Whig Party, formation of the Republican Party, and violent conflict in "Bleeding Kansas" as pro- and anti-slavery settlers competed for control.</p>
                
                <h3>Bleeding Kansas</h3>
                <p>Period of violent conflict in Kansas Territory between pro-slavery and anti-slavery settlers following the Kansas-Nebraska Act. The violence included the sacking of Lawrence by pro-slavery forces and John Brown's retaliatory killings at Pottawatomie Creek. The territory saw competing governments and constitutions, with the pro-slavery Lecompton Constitution initially supported by President Buchanan but ultimately rejected. "Bleeding Kansas" foreshadowed the larger civil conflict to come and radicalized many participants on both sides of the slavery debate.</p>

                <h2>Growing Sectional Crisis</h2>
                
                <h3>Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857)</h3>
                <p>Supreme Court case concerning whether Dred Scott, an enslaved person, gained freedom by living in free territory. Chief Justice Roger Taney's majority opinion made several momentous rulings:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>African Americans were not and could not be citizens of the United States</li>
                    <li>Residence in free territory did not make an enslaved person free</li>
                    <li>Congress had no power to prohibit slavery in federal territories, making the Missouri Compromise unconstitutional</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The decision outraged Republicans, undermined popular sovereignty, and made a political solution to the slavery issue increasingly difficult, pushing the nation closer to civil war.</p>
                
                <h3>Lincoln-Douglas Debates (1858)</h3>
                <p>Series of seven debates between Republican Abraham Lincoln and Democrat Stephen Douglas during their contest for an Illinois Senate seat. The debates focused primarily on slavery expansion, with Lincoln arguing that slavery should not spread to new territories while Douglas defended popular sovereignty. Lincoln's "House Divided" speech articulated his view that the nation could not permanently endure half-slave and half-free. Though Lincoln lost the Senate race, the debates elevated his national profile and positioned him for the 1860 presidential contest.</p>
                
                <h3>John Brown's Raid (1859)</h3>
                <p>Failed attempt by abolitionist John Brown to spark a slave uprising by seizing the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry, Virginia (now West Virginia). Brown and his small band were quickly defeated by forces under Robert E. Lee, and Brown was subsequently tried and executed for treason. The raid deeply alarmed Southerners, who saw it as evidence of Northern aggression, while many Northerners condemned Brown's violence but sympathized with his anti-slavery goals. The raid intensified the sectional crisis and pushed moderates toward more extreme positions.</p>
                
                <h3>Election of 1860</h3>
                <p>Watershed presidential contest that precipitated secession. The Democratic Party split along sectional lines, with Northern Democrats nominating Stephen Douglas and Southern Democrats choosing John C. Breckinridge. The Constitutional Union Party, appealing to border state moderates, nominated John Bell. Republican Abraham Lincoln won with just 40% of the popular vote, carried entirely from Northern states. Though Lincoln pledged not to interfere with slavery where it existed, his victory without a single Southern electoral vote convinced many Southerners that their interests could no longer be protected within the Union.</p>
                
                <h3>Secession</h3>
                <p>Process by which eleven Southern states left the Union between December 1860 and June 1861. South Carolina seceded first, followed by the other Deep South states before Lincoln's inauguration. The Upper South states (Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas) seceded only after the conflict at Fort Sumter and Lincoln's call for troops. The seceding states formed the Confederate States of America, elected Jefferson Davis as president, and established a government in Richmond, Virginia. Lincoln and the Republicans rejected the constitutional right to secession, setting the stage for civil war.</p>

                <h2>Civil War</h2>
                
                <h3>Fort Sumter (April 1861)</h3>
                <p>First battle of the Civil War, fought in Charleston Harbor, South Carolina. When Lincoln attempted to resupply the federal garrison, Confederate forces under P.G.T. Beauregard bombarded the fort, forcing its surrender after 34 hours. Though bloodless, the attack on a federal installation removed any possibility of a peaceful resolution to the secession crisis. Lincoln's subsequent call for 75,000 volunteers to suppress the rebellion prompted the Upper South states to secede.</p>
                
                <h3>Bull Run/Manassas (July 1861)</h3>
                <p>First major battle of the war, fought in northern Virginia. Initial Union advances were repulsed, and the arrival of Confederate reinforcements under General Thomas "Stonewall" Jackson turned the battle into a rout, with disorganized Union forces retreating to Washington. The Confederate victory dispelled hopes for a quick war and forced both sides to prepare for a longer, more intensive conflict. The battle demonstrated that citizen-soldiers would need extensive training before becoming effective fighting forces.</p>
                
                <h3>Emancipation Proclamation (1863)</h3>
                <p>Presidential order issued by Lincoln that freed slaves in Confederate-held territories. Issued after the Union victory at Antietam in September 1862 but taking effect January 1, 1863, the proclamation transformed the character and purpose of the war. While it did not immediately free any slaves (applying only to areas outside Union control) and exempted the border states, it made the abolition of slavery an explicit war aim. This shift in purpose helped prevent European recognition of the Confederacy and encouraged enslaved people to flee to Union lines, undermining the Confederate economy.</p>
                
                <h3>Antietam (September 1862)</h3>
                <p>Bloodiest single day of the war, fought near Sharpsburg, Maryland. Confederate General Robert E. Lee's first invasion of the North was halted by Union forces under General George McClellan. Though McClellan failed to pursue the retreating Confederates, the battle was sufficient for Lincoln to issue the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation from a position of military strength. The battle was strategically crucial in preventing potential British and French intervention on behalf of the Confederacy.</p>
                
                <h3>Gettysburg (July 1863)</h3>
                <p>Decisive battle in the Eastern Theater, fought in Pennsylvania. Lee's second invasion of the North was defeated after three days of intense fighting, culminating in the failure of "Pickett's Charge" against the Union center. The Confederate defeat ended any realistic hope of European recognition or a negotiated peace. Lincoln's subsequent Gettysburg Address reframed the war in terms of national ideals and the preservation of democratic government. Combined with the fall of Vicksburg the same week, the battle marked a major turning point in the conflict.</p>
                
                <h3>Vicksburg (July 1863)</h3>
                <p>Union victory in Mississippi that secured control of the Mississippi River, effectively splitting the Confederacy. After a lengthy campaign, General Ulysses S. Grant besieged the fortress city, forcing its surrender on July 4, 1863. The victory gave the Union complete control of the Mississippi River, isolating the Trans-Mississippi Confederacy (Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas) and allowing for the free flow of commerce from the Midwest to New Orleans and beyond.</p>
                
                <h3>General Ulysses S. Grant</h3>
                <p>Union commander who led final campaigns against Confederate forces. After his successes in the Western Theater, Grant was promoted to general-in-chief of all Union armies in March 1864. His strategy emphasized coordinated offensives across multiple fronts and a focus on destroying Confederate field armies rather than just capturing territory. Despite heavy casualties in the Overland Campaign against Lee in Virginia, Grant's persistence and willingness to leverage the North's superior resources eventually led to Union victory.</p>
                
                <h3>Appomattox Court House (April 1865)</h3>
                <p>Site of Lee's surrender to Grant, effectively ending the Civil War. After the fall of Richmond and a final retreat westward, Lee's Army of Northern Virginia was surrounded by superior Union forces. The surrender terms were generous, allowing Confederate soldiers to return home on parole and officers to keep their sidearms and horses. Grant's magnanimity set the tone for reconciliation, though other Confederate armies would not surrender until later in 1865.</p>
                
                <h3>Lincoln's Assassination (April 14, 1865)</h3>
                <p>Murder of President Lincoln by Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C. Coming just days after Lee's surrender, the assassination shocked a nation beginning to celebrate peace. Lincoln's death elevated Vice President Andrew Johnson to the presidency and removed the one person who might have balanced punitive and conciliatory approaches to Reconstruction. The assassination also intensified Northern anger toward the South, complicating reconciliation efforts.</p>

                <h2>Reconstruction</h2>
                
                <h3>Presidential Reconstruction</h3>
                <p>Initial approach to rebuilding the Union, implemented by Presidents Lincoln and Johnson. Lincoln's Ten Percent Plan offered relatively lenient terms, requiring only 10% of a state's 1860 voters to take a loyalty oath before reorganizing a state government. Johnson's policy was similarly lenient, allowing rapid readmission of Southern states with minimal conditions. Both plans focused on restoring the Union rather than transforming Southern society or securing rights for freed people. Presidential Reconstruction saw the emergence of Black Codes in Southern states, restricting freedmen's rights and prompting congressional opposition.</p>
                
                <h3>Radical Reconstruction</h3>
                <p>Congressional approach that took control of the process from President Johnson after the 1866 elections. Radical Republicans, led by figures like Thaddeus Stevens and Charles Sumner, passed the Reconstruction Acts of 1867, dividing the South into five military districts and requiring states to ratify the 14th Amendment, write new constitutions, and guarantee black male suffrage before readmission. This period saw significant Black political participation, the establishment of public education systems, and other reforms. However, Radical Reconstruction faced violent opposition from groups like the Ku Klux Klan and gradually lost Northern support.</p>
                
                <h3>Freedmen's Bureau</h3>
                <p>Federal agency established in 1865 to assist former slaves and poor whites in the South. The Bureau provided humanitarian aid, established schools and hospitals, negotiated labor contracts, and worked to protect freedmen's civil rights. Despite chronic underfunding and limited personnel, the Bureau had significant success in education, helping establish schools and universities that would serve the Black community for generations. However, in land redistribution and securing lasting economic independence for freedmen, the Bureau was largely unsuccessful.</p>
                
                <h3>Black Codes</h3>
                <p>Laws passed by Southern states under Presidential Reconstruction restricting freedmen's rights. These codes varied by state but typically:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Limited occupations available to Black people</li>
                    <li>Restricted property ownership</li>
                    <li>Imposed harsh vagrancy laws that could result in forced labor</li>
                    <li>Restricted mobility and assembly</li>
                    <li>Created separate court systems with different punishments</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The Black Codes effectively attempted to recreate plantation labor discipline without formal slavery. Northern outrage at these laws helped fuel the move toward Radical Reconstruction.</p>
                
                <h3>Reconstruction Amendments</h3>
                <p>Constitutional amendments that fundamentally altered American citizenship and rights:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>13th Amendment (1865):</strong> Abolished slavery and involuntary servitude throughout the United States</li>
                    <li><strong>14th Amendment (1868):</strong> Established birthright citizenship, guaranteed equal protection under the law, and due process for all citizens</li>
                    <li><strong>15th Amendment (1870):</strong> Prohibited denial of voting rights based on race, color, or previous condition of servitude</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These amendments represented a constitutional revolution, dramatically expanding federal power to protect individual rights against state infringement. However, narrow court interpretations and inadequate enforcement limited their immediate impact on Southern race relations.</p>
                
                <h3>Compromise of 1877</h3>
                <p>Informal agreement that resolved the disputed presidential election of 1876 and ended Reconstruction. Democrat Samuel Tilden won the popular vote, but Republican Rutherford B. Hayes contested the electoral votes of several Southern states. The compromise gave Hayes the presidency in exchange for the withdrawal of federal troops from the South, ending formal Reconstruction. The compromise reflected Northern fatigue with Reconstruction and prioritization of national reunification and economic development over civil rights for African Americans. It ushered in the "Redemption" era of Democratic control and racial segregation in the South.</p>

                <h2>Legacy of the Civil War and Reconstruction</h2>
                
                <h3>Constitutional Impact</h3>
                <p>The Civil War and Reconstruction permanently altered the constitutional order. The conflict definitively established the supremacy of the federal government over the states and ended serious consideration of secession as a political option. The Reconstruction Amendments expanded federal power to protect individual rights and redefined American citizenship. However, the abandonment of Reconstruction also established precedents for limiting federal intervention to protect minority rights, patterns that would persist until the mid-20th century.</p>
                
                <h3>Social and Economic Changes</h3>
                <p>The Civil War accelerated Northern industrialization and expanded federal economic involvement through policies like the Homestead Act, transcontinental railroad subsidies, and land-grant colleges. In the South, the plantation system was transformed, with sharecropping and tenant farming replacing slavery but maintaining economic subordination for many Black farmers. The postwar period saw increasing integration of the national economy but also the entrenchment of regional disparities in wealth and development.</p>
                
                <h3>Race Relations</h3>
                <p>The end of slavery represented a momentous advance, but the promise of full equality remained unfulfilled. The brief period of Black political participation during Reconstruction demonstrated the possibilities of a more egalitarian society but also provoked violent backlash. The collapse of Reconstruction set the stage for the Jim Crow era of segregation and disenfranchisement that would dominate Southern race relations until the mid-20th century. Nonetheless, the emancipation of four million people and their struggle for citizenship established foundations for later civil rights movements.</p>
                
                <h3>Memory and National Reconciliation</h3>
                <p>In the decades following the Civil War, competing narratives about the conflict emerged. The "Lost Cause" interpretation, popularized in the South, portrayed the Confederate cause as noble and principled rather than centered on slavery. As white Americans North and South sought reconciliation in the late 19th century, the experiences and perspectives of African Americans were increasingly marginalized in popular memory. Public commemorations, monuments, and early histories often emphasized military valor and national reunion while downplaying slavery and emancipation as central to the conflict's meaning.</p>
