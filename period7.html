                <h2>Key Themes</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Progressive reforms addressing social and political issues.</li>
                    <li>U.S. emergence as a world power.</li>
                    <li>Economic upheaval and global conflict.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Progressive Era</h2>
                
                <h3>Progressive Movement</h3>
                <p>Broad-based reform movement from approximately 1890 to 1920 that sought to address problems created by industrialization, urbanization, immigration, and political corruption. Progressives represented diverse constituencies, including middle-class professionals, social workers, labor activists, religious leaders, and farmers, united by belief in the possibility of social improvement through government action. While not a unified movement, progressivism generally emphasized efficiency, scientific expertise, regulation of business, expanded democracy, and social justice. Progressive reforms transformed American governance at all levels, shifting power from local party organizations to state and federal bureaucracies staffed by professional experts.</p>
                
                <h3>Muckrakers</h3>
                <p>Investigative journalists who exposed corruption and social problems, deriving their nickname from President Theodore Roosevelt's comparison to a character who could only see filth. Through newspapers, magazines, and books, muckrakers documented conditions that demanded reform, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ida Tarbell:</strong> Standard Oil's monopolistic practices in "The History of the Standard Oil Company"</li>
                    <li><strong>Lincoln Steffens:</strong> Municipal corruption in "The Shame of the Cities"</li>
                    <li><strong>Upton Sinclair:</strong> Unsanitary meatpacking conditions in "The Jungle" (which led to the Pure Food and Drug Act)</li>
                    <li><strong>Jacob Riis:</strong> Urban poverty in "How the Other Half Lives"</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Muckraking journalism harnessed new mass-circulation technologies to build public support for reform and expanded understanding of journalism's role in democratic society.</p>
                
                <h3>Political Reforms</h3>
                <p>Progressives implemented numerous changes to democratic procedures and governmental structure, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Direct election of senators:</strong> 17th Amendment (1913) replaced selection by state legislatures, reducing corruption and increasing democratic participation</li>
                    <li><strong>Initiative, referendum, and recall:</strong> State-level reforms allowing citizens to propose legislation, vote directly on laws, and remove officials from office</li>
                    <li><strong>Direct primary:</strong> Process enabling voters rather than party leaders to select candidates</li>
                    <li><strong>Commission and city manager systems:</strong> Municipal reforms replacing corrupt mayor-council structures with professional administration</li>
                    <li><strong>Women's suffrage:</strong> 19th Amendment (1920) granting women the right to vote, culminating decades of activism</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These reforms aimed to increase citizen power in government while reducing the influence of political machines and special interests.</p>
                
                <h3>Progressive Legislation</h3>
                <p>The era saw unprecedented government regulation of business and social welfare measures, particularly at the federal level during the presidencies of Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, and Woodrow Wilson. Key legislation included:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pure Food and Drug Act (1906):</strong> Prohibited adulterated or misbranded food and drugs</li>
                    <li><strong>Meat Inspection Act (1906):</strong> Established federal inspection of meat products</li>
                    <li><strong>Federal Reserve Act (1913):</strong> Created central banking system to stabilize currency and credit</li>
                    <li><strong>Clayton Antitrust Act (1914):</strong> Strengthened antitrust laws and exempted labor unions from being considered illegal combinations</li>
                    <li><strong>Federal Trade Commission Act (1914):</strong> Created agency to prevent unfair business practices</li>
                    <li><strong>Workmen's Compensation Laws:</strong> State-level protections for injured workers</li>
                    <li><strong>Child Labor Laws:</strong> Restrictions on employment of children, though Supreme Court struck down federal legislation</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These measures represented a fundamental shift in American governance, expanding government's role in regulating the economy and protecting citizens from market abuses.</p>
                
                <h3>Progressive Presidents</h3>
                <p><strong>Theodore Roosevelt (1901-1909)</strong> expanded presidential power and federal regulation while balancing progressive and conservative elements. His "Square Deal" policies included antitrust actions against Northern Securities and other monopolies, conservation of natural resources, and consumer protections like the Pure Food and Drug Act. Roosevelt viewed the presidency as a "bully pulpit" for advocating reform and believed in distinguishing between "good" and "bad" trusts rather than breaking up all large corporations.</p>
                
                <p><strong>William Howard Taft (1909-1913)</strong>, Roosevelt's chosen successor, continued many progressive policies but with a more conservative, legalistic approach. His administration actually initiated more antitrust cases than Roosevelt's and supported the 16th Amendment (income tax) and 17th Amendment (direct election of senators). However, conflicts with progressive Republicans over tariff reform and conservation, particularly the Ballinger-Pinchot controversy, led to a party split in 1912.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Woodrow Wilson (1913-1921)</strong> implemented a progressive agenda called the "New Freedom," emphasizing economic opportunity through breaking up monopolies and reducing tariffs. Despite his initial skepticism of big government, Wilson oversaw significant federal expansion, including creation of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Trade Commission, and child labor regulations. His administration also strengthened government's relationship with organized labor and enacted the first restricted immigration literacy test. Wilson's progressivism focused on economic issues rather than social reforms like racial equality.</p>

                <h2>American Imperialism</h2>
                
                <h3>Spanish-American War (1898)</h3>
                <p>Brief conflict with Spain that marked America's emergence as a global power. The war was driven by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>American sympathy for Cuban independence struggles against Spanish rule</li>
                    <li>Yellow journalism dramatizing Spanish atrocities</li>
                    <li>The explosion of the USS Maine in Havana harbor</li>
                    <li>Commercial interests seeking markets and resources</li>
                    <li>Strategic considerations, especially regarding naval power</li>
                </ul>
                <p>American victories came quickly, with Admiral Dewey defeating the Spanish fleet in Manila Bay and American land forces winning in Cuba, aided by Cuban rebels and volunteers like Theodore Roosevelt's Rough Riders. The Treaty of Paris granted the U.S. control of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines, while Cuba gained independence under significant American influence codified in the Platt Amendment, which granted the U.S. intervention rights and a naval base at Guantanamo Bay.</p>
                
                <h3>Philippine-American War (1899-1902)</h3>
                <p>Conflict between American forces and Filipino nationalists who had expected independence rather than American colonization following Spain's defeat. Led by Emilio Aguinaldo, Filipino revolutionaries waged guerrilla warfare against American troops, who responded with tactics including concentration camps and torture. The brutal conflict resulted in approximately 4,200 American deaths and estimates of Filipino deaths ranging from 200,000 to 1 million, many from disease and famine. American victory established U.S. colonial control while exposing tensions between imperialism and American democratic ideals. Anti-imperialist critics including Mark Twain and William Jennings Bryan opposed the war, while supporters emphasized America's "civilizing mission" and strategic interests.</p>
                
                <h3>Panama Canal</h3>
                <p>Massive engineering project connecting Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, completed in 1914 after a decade of construction. The canal's development began with American support for Panamanian independence from Colombia in 1903, with the U.S. immediately negotiating rights to build and control the canal. The project required overcoming immense challenges, including tropical diseases like yellow fever and malaria (addressed through public health measures led by Dr. William Gorgas) and the engineering complexity of creating a lock system across the isthmus. The canal dramatically reduced shipping distances between East and West coasts and enhanced American naval power by allowing rapid fleet movement between oceans. It represented both American technological achievement and imperial reach in the Western Hemisphere.</p>
                
                <h3>Roosevelt Corollary</h3>
                <p>1904 extension of the Monroe Doctrine asserting U.S. right to intervene in Latin American countries experiencing chaos or unable to meet financial obligations to European powers. President Theodore Roosevelt announced this policy after European nations threatened to collect Venezuelan debts by force, declaring that the U.S. would serve as the "policeman" of the Western Hemisphere. The policy was used to justify numerous U.S. military interventions in the Caribbean and Central America, including in the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Mexico. While framed as preventing European colonization, the Corollary effectively established American hegemony in the region, with interventions often protecting American economic interests while limiting Latin American sovereignty.</p>
                
                <h3>Dollar Diplomacy</h3>
                <p>Foreign policy approach during the Taft administration encouraging American banks and businesses to invest in foreign countries, particularly in Latin America and Asia, to advance U.S. interests. Secretary of State Philander Knox argued that replacing "bullets with dollars" would create stability through economic rather than military intervention. In practice, however, dollar diplomacy often involved both economic penetration and military force, as in Nicaragua, where U.S. marines were deployed to protect American investments and install pro-American governments. The policy expanded American economic influence abroad while generating resentment in target countries, where it was viewed as economic imperialism that benefited American corporations at the expense of local development.</p>

                <h2>World War I</h2>
                
                <h3>U.S. Neutrality (1914-1917)</h3>
                <p>American policy during the first years of World War I, reflecting the public's traditional isolationism and conflicted sympathies. President Wilson formally proclaimed neutrality but unofficially favored the Allied powers (Britain, France, Russia), with whom the U.S. had stronger cultural and economic ties. American neutrality was compromised by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Economic relationships: U.S. trade with Britain and France increased dramatically while German trade was limited by British naval blockade</li>
                    <li>Financial relationships: American banks made large loans to Allied governments</li>
                    <li>British propaganda effectiveness in American media</li>
                    <li>German submarine warfare that endangered American ships and citizens</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These factors gradually shifted American public opinion against Germany, particularly after incidents like the Lusitania sinking, though significant anti-war sentiment persisted, especially among German-Americans, Irish-Americans, and progressives.</p>
                
                <h3>Lusitania Sinking (1915)</h3>
                <p>German submarine attack on British passenger liner that killed 1,198 people, including 128 Americans. The sinking turned American public opinion strongly against Germany, though Wilson maintained official neutrality while warning that further attacks would lead to diplomatic rupture. Germany temporarily restricted submarine warfare following American protests, but eventually resumed unrestricted attacks in 1917, calculating that they could defeat Britain before American intervention would make a difference. The Lusitania incident highlighted the difficulty of maintaining neutrality in modern warfare affecting civilian shipping and revealed tensions between Wilson's diplomatic restraint and growing public outrage over German actions.</p>
                
                <h3>Zimmermann Telegram (1917)</h3>
                <p>Secret diplomatic communication from German Foreign Minister Arthur Zimmermann to Mexico, proposing an alliance against the United States if America entered the war. The telegram, intercepted and decoded by British intelligence in January 1917, promised Mexico the return of territory lost in the Mexican-American War (Texas, New Mexico, Arizona) in exchange for support. When published in American newspapers in March, the telegram outraged the public and contributed significantly to the decision for war. The incident demonstrated both German desperation as they resumed unrestricted submarine warfare and the impact of new intelligence technologies in modern diplomacy and warfare.</p>
                
                <h3>American Expeditionary Force</h3>
                <p>U.S. military units sent to Europe under General John J. Pershing, eventually totaling over 2 million troops. When America entered the war in 1917, the regular army numbered only about 127,500 soldiers, requiring rapid expansion through a selective service system that ultimately registered 24 million men and drafted 2.8 million. Pershing insisted on maintaining the AEF as an independent force rather than integrating American units into French and British armies. American forces played a decisive role in stopping the final German offensive of spring 1918 and in the subsequent Allied advance that led to German surrender. The war experience demonstrated American industrial and organizational capacity while establishing the U.S. as a major military power.</p>
                
                <h3>Home Front</h3>
                <p>The war dramatically transformed American society, expanding federal power and reorganizing the economy for maximum production. Key developments included:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>War Industries Board coordinating industrial production</li>
                    <li>Food Administration managing agricultural production and rationing</li>
                    <li>Railroad Administration federalizing rail transportation</li>
                    <li>Committee on Public Information creating propaganda to build support</li>
                    <li>Expanded opportunities for women in industry and public life</li>
                    <li>Great Migration of African Americans to Northern industrial cities</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The war also saw significant restrictions on civil liberties, with the Espionage Act (1917) and Sedition Act (1918) allowing prosecution of war critics, and intense pressure for conformity through "100% Americanism" campaigns that targeted German-Americans and political radicals, especially socialists and labor activists.</p>
                
                <h3>Treaty of Versailles</h3>
                <p>Peace agreement ending World War I, negotiated at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. President Wilson participated personally in negotiations, advocating his Fourteen Points plan for a just peace. The final treaty included creation of the League of Nations, Wilson's highest priority, but also imposed harsh terms on Germany, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"War guilt" clause blaming Germany for the conflict</li>
                    <li>Massive reparations payments</li>
                    <li>Territorial losses, including all colonies</li>
                    <li>Severe military restrictions</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The treaty faced significant opposition in the U.S. Senate, with Republicans led by Henry Cabot Lodge demanding revisions, particularly regarding Article X of the League Covenant, which could commit the U.S. to military action without congressional approval. Wilson refused to compromise, suffering a stroke while campaigning for the treaty, and the Senate rejected both the original treaty and a version with Lodge's reservations. The U.S. ultimately signed separate peace treaties with the Central Powers in 1921, never joining the League of Nations.</p>
                
                <h3>Red Scare (1919-1920)</h3>
                <p>Period of intense fear of Bolshevism and leftist radicalism following the Russian Revolution and World War I. This fear was fueled by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Postwar labor unrest, including over 3,600 strikes in 1919 involving 4 million workers</li>
                    <li>A series of anarchist bombings targeting government officials and business leaders</li>
                    <li>The Seattle General Strike and Boston Police Strike, perceived as revolutionary threats</li>
                    <li>Sensationalist media coverage exaggerating radical influence</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer responded with the Palmer Raids, arresting thousands of suspected radicals, often without warrants, and deporting hundreds of foreign-born individuals. The climate of fear also contributed to the conviction of anarchists Sacco and Vanzetti despite questionable evidence. The Red Scare reflected postwar anxieties about social change while establishing patterns of equating dissent with disloyalty that would reappear during later periods of international tension.</p>

                <h2>Great Depression and New Deal</h2>
                
                <h3>Stock Market Crash (October 1929)</h3>
                <p>Dramatic collapse of stock prices that initiated the Great Depression. The crash followed a speculative bubble in which stock prices rose far beyond underlying economic values, fueled by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Easy credit through broker loans with minimal margins</li>
                    <li>Unregulated market manipulation and insider trading</li>
                    <li>Popular enthusiasm for stock investment as a path to wealth</li>
                    <li>Underlying economic weaknesses masked by market euphoria</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The market lost approximately 40% of its value in two months (October-November 1929), wiping out billions in wealth and undermining consumer and business confidence. While the crash did not directly cause the Depression, it exposed and accelerated fundamental economic problems, including weak banking structures, excessive debt, agricultural crisis, maldistribution of wealth, and international economic imbalances stemming from World War I.</p>
                
                <h3>Herbert Hoover</h3>
                <p>President (1929-1933) whose administration coincided with the Depression's onset and deepening. Contrary to popular perception, Hoover did implement unprecedented federal responses to the crisis, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reconstruction Finance Corporation providing loans to banks and businesses</li>
                    <li>Home Loan Bank Act supporting mortgage lending</li>
                    <li>Federal Farm Board attempting to stabilize agricultural prices</li>
                    <li>Increased federal public works spending</li>
                </ul>
                <p>However, Hoover's actions were constrained by his philosophy that direct federal relief would undermine individual character and local responsibility. He opposed deficit spending, direct federal employment programs, and maintained high tariffs through the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, which worsened international economic conditions. Hoover's reputation suffered as conditions deteriorated, with "Hoovervilles" (shantytowns) and "Hoover blankets" (newspapers used for warmth) mockingly named after him.</p>
                
                <h3>First New Deal (1933-34)</h3>
                <p>President Franklin D. Roosevelt's initial response to the Depression during his first hundred days in office. The First New Deal focused on immediate relief and economic stabilization through agencies including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Banking:</strong> Emergency Banking Act and Glass-Steagall Act stabilized banking system</li>
                    <li><strong>Relief:</strong> Federal Emergency Relief Administration provided grants to states; Civilian Conservation Corps employed young men in conservation projects</li>
                    <li><strong>Agriculture:</strong> Agricultural Adjustment Act paid farmers to reduce production to raise prices</li>
                    <li><strong>Industry:</strong> National Industrial Recovery Act established codes of fair competition and labor standards</li>
                    <li><strong>Regional Development:</strong> Tennessee Valley Authority created comprehensive development program</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The First New Deal represented pragmatic experimentation rather than coherent ideology, drawing ideas from progressivism, business planning, and various economic theories. While improving conditions somewhat, it faced criticism from both right (claiming excessive government power) and left (arguing insufficient structural change), setting the stage for more ambitious Second New Deal programs.</p>
                
                <h3>Second New Deal (1935-36)</h3>
                <p>More ambitious and reform-oriented phase of New Deal policies, responding to continuing economic problems and growing radical challenges from figures like Huey Long. Key Second New Deal programs included:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Works Progress Administration:</strong> Massive employment program funding public works and cultural projects</li>
                    <li><strong>Social Security Act:</strong> Created retirement benefits, unemployment insurance, aid to dependent children and disabled</li>
                    <li><strong>Wagner Act (National Labor Relations Act):</strong> Guaranteed workers' rights to organize and collectively bargain</li>
                    <li><strong>Banking Act of 1935:</strong> Strengthened Federal Reserve and banking regulations</li>
                    <li><strong>Wealth Tax Act:</strong> Increased taxes on high incomes and large corporations</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The Second New Deal shifted emphasis from economic recovery to economic security and wealth redistribution, establishing a larger government role in ensuring social welfare. These programs created an enduring social safety net while fostering Democratic Party dominance through the "New Deal Coalition" of urban workers, farmers, ethnic and racial minorities, and Southern whites.</p>
                
                <h3>New Deal Coalition</h3>
                <p>Political alliance supporting the Democratic Party from the 1930s through 1960s, including diverse groups united by economic interests and loyalty to Roosevelt. Key coalition elements included:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Urban ethnic voters, particularly Catholic and Jewish immigrants and their children</li>
                    <li>Industrial workers and labor unions</li>
                    <li>African Americans in Northern cities (shifting from traditional Republican loyalty)</li>
                    <li>White Southerners (the "Solid South")</li>
                    <li>Western and Midwestern farmers</li>
                    <li>Progressive intellectuals and professionals</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This coalition enabled Democratic dominance in presidential elections (winning five consecutive elections from 1932 to 1948) and Congress (controlling both houses almost continuously from 1932 to 1952). The coalition contained inherent tensions, particularly regarding civil rights, which eventually contributed to its fracturing in the 1960s as Southern whites left the Democratic Party in response to civil rights legislation.</p>

                <h2>World War II</h2>
                
                <h3>Isolationism</h3>
                <p>American reluctance to involve itself in European conflicts during the 1930s, reflecting disillusionment with World War I and focus on domestic economic problems. Isolationist sentiment led to Neutrality Acts (1935-1937) restricting arms sales and loans to belligerent nations and prohibiting Americans from traveling on belligerent ships. This position was supported by diverse groups including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Progressive peace advocates who viewed World War I as driven by arms manufacturers ("merchants of death")</li>
                    <li>America First Committee, which argued European problems should not concern Americans</li>
                    <li>Conservative nationalists opposed to international entanglements</li>
                    <li>Socialist and communist groups (until Nazi-Soviet Pact ended in 1941)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Roosevelt gradually moved American policy away from strict neutrality with initiatives like the Quarantine Speech (1937), "cash and carry" provisions allowing arms sales to democracies, and ultimately Lend-Lease (1941), which provided massive military aid to Britain and later the Soviet Union.</p>
                
                <h3>Lend-Lease (1941)</h3>
                <p>Program providing military supplies to nations fighting the Axis powers, primarily the United Kingdom, Soviet Union, and China. Rather than selling arms (restricted by neutrality legislation and Allied financial limitations), the U.S. would "lend" war materials to be returned or compensated after the war. Roosevelt described the program as lending a garden hose to a neighbor whose house was on fire—a practical necessity rather than a legal technicality. The program ultimately provided over $50 billion in aid, sustaining Allied war efforts while dramatically expanding American production capacity. Lend-Lease represented America's transformation into the "Arsenal of Democracy" and effectively ended any pretense of neutrality before formal entry into the war.</p>
                
                <h3>Pearl Harbor (December 7, 1941)</h3>
                <p>Surprise Japanese attack on the U.S. naval base in Hawaii that brought America into World War II. Japan launched the attack to neutralize the U.S. Pacific Fleet, which could threaten its planned conquests in Southeast Asia. The raid damaged or destroyed 19 ships (including 8 battleships) and 188 aircraft, and killed 2,403 Americans. While achieving tactical surprise, the attack failed strategically by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Missing the American aircraft carriers, which were at sea</li>
                    <li>Failing to destroy maintenance facilities and fuel storage</li>
                    <li>Unifying American public opinion in favor of war</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Roosevelt's description of December 7 as "a date which will live in infamy" resonated with the American public, who overwhelmingly supported the declaration of war against Japan. Germany and Italy declared war on the United States days later, bringing America into the European conflict as well.</p>
                
                <h3>D-Day (June 6, 1944)</h3>
                <p>Allied amphibious invasion of Normandy, France, opening the "Second Front" against Nazi Germany in Western Europe. The operation, officially "Operation Overlord," involved over 156,000 American, British, and Canadian troops landing on five beaches, preceded by airborne landings and massive air and naval bombardment. Despite strong German defenses and difficult weather conditions, the Allies established a beachhead and broke out of Normandy by late July. The invasion represented an enormous logistical achievement, requiring years of planning, specialized equipment development, and deception operations to mislead German forces about the landing location. American forces led by General Dwight D. Eisenhower played the predominant role in planning and executing the operation, which began the liberation of Western Europe and accelerated Germany's defeat.</p>
                
                <h3>Manhattan Project</h3>
                <p>Secret government program to develop atomic weapons, driven by fears that Nazi Germany might develop such weapons first. The project, directed by General Leslie Groves with scientific leadership from J. Robert Oppenheimer, involved:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Over 125,000 workers at secret facilities across the United States</li>
                    <li>Unprecedented government investment of $2 billion ($29 billion in modern value)</li>
                    <li>Collaboration among leading scientists, including many European refugees</li>
                    <li>Revolutionary advances in physics, engineering, and industrial processes</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The project successfully tested the first nuclear device at Alamogordo, New Mexico, in July 1945. Following Germany's defeat, President Truman authorized the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945, which killed approximately 200,000 Japanese civilians and hastened Japan's surrender. The Manhattan Project demonstrated American scientific and industrial capacity while initiating the atomic age and establishing patterns of military-scientific cooperation that would continue throughout the Cold War.</p>
                
                <h3>Home Front</h3>
                <p>American society underwent dramatic transformation during World War II, with unprecedented government management of the economy and social changes that would have lasting impacts. Key developments included:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Economic Mobilization:</strong> War Production Board and other agencies converted civilian industries to military production, dramatically increasing output</li>
                    <li><strong>Employment:</strong> Unemployment virtually disappeared as workforce expanded by 20%, including 6 million women ("Rosie the Riveter")</li>
                    <li><strong>Migration:</strong> 15 million Americans relocated for war work, especially to West Coast and Southern cities</li>
                    <li><strong>Civil Rights:</strong> African Americans demanded "Double V" campaign for victory abroad and at home; A. Philip Randolph's threatened march led to Fair Employment Practices Committee</li>
                    <li><strong>Rationing:</strong> Civilian consumption restricted through rationing of gasoline, tires, meat, sugar, and other products</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The war brought unprecedented prosperity after the Depression, with per capita income rising 70% between 1939 and 1944, while laying groundwork for postwar prosperity through accumulated savings, new industrial capacity, and technological advances.</p>
                
                <h3>Japanese American Internment</h3>
                <p>Forced relocation and incarceration of approximately 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry, two-thirds of whom were American citizens. Following Executive Order 9066 (February 1942), Japanese Americans on the West Coast were removed from their homes and confined in remote "relocation centers" administered by the War Relocation Authority. Internees lost businesses, farms, and personal property worth millions of dollars, receiving minimal compensation. The policy, justified on national security grounds despite lack of evidence of Japanese American disloyalty, reflected long-standing anti-Asian prejudice on the West Coast and wartime hysteria. The Supreme Court upheld internment in Korematsu v. United States (1944), though Justice Murphy's dissent called it "legalization of racism." Many young Japanese American men demonstrated loyalty by serving in the highly decorated 442nd Regimental Combat Team while their families remained interned. The government formally apologized and provided reparations through the Civil Liberties Act of 1988.</p>
